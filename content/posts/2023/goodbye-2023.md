## Time to Say Goodbye to 2023

Let's go back to the end of 2022. The COVID period had finally been officially declared OVER. We just thought we were able to let ourselves go at last.

But things were getting changed.

## January 2023

(Another) last day of layoffs. Started looking for next role.

## February 2023

We made a family travel to Thailand (Phuket and Bangkok) fo a week. Met a great friend.

## August 2023

Received the offer of a DevRel role in Web3 security company. Started my 45 days adventure in blockchain.

## September 2023

Left the company after 45 days just before the national holiday.

## Farewell 2023

End.
